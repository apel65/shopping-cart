# shopping-cart using Vanilla JavaScript & DOM

![Mobile Shopping cart](https://github.com/apelmahmudDev/shopping-cart/blob/master/images/mobile-shopping-cart.png?raw=true)

- I played here with DOM (Document Object Model). 🤩
- I caught many HTML elements by calling those ids with help of DOM. 🐱‍🏍
- I give life this project by build functionality using DOM. ✨
- eventually, it's prepared for use by the user. 💻
